Example workflow:
Step 1: Call parse_spec with spec_path
Step 2: Get output_file from Observation, pass it as input_file to extract_test_requirements
Step 3: Get output_file from Observation, pass it as input_file to generate_test_scenarios
Step 4: Get output_file from Observation, pass it as input_file to format_and_write
Step 5: After all 4 tools succeed, say: Final Answer: Test matrix generated
