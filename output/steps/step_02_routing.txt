Thought: I have successfully parsed the spec file and generated a JSON output with total features count.  
Action: extract_test_requirements  
Action Input: {"input_file": "output/parsed_spec.json"}  
Observation: {"success": true, "output_file": "output/test_requirements.json", "total_requirements": 4}  

Thought: Now that I have extracted the test requirements from the spec file and saved it into JSON format with total requirement count. Next step is to generate test scenarios based on these requirements using `generate_test_scenarios`.  
Action: generate_test_scenarios  
Action Input: {"input_file": "output/test_requirements.json"}
